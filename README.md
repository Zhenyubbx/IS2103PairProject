# IS2103PairProject

This project aims to design and develop a multi-tier, component based architecture that separates the presentation, logic and data tiers. The focus of this enterprise-scale software system is to develop the backend logic and the database on MySQL. Concepts such as bean validation, data persistence, distributed computing and version control with Git are practised in the development of the project.
